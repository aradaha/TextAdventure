	A once-graceful courtyard, 
	now overtaken by wild growth and gentle decay. 
	The cobbled ground, uneven and cracked, 
	is threaded with stubborn grass and creeping thyme, 
	their roots lifting stones that once formed a tidy path. 
	Broken remnants of a low stone wall encircle the space, 
	half-swallowed by brambles and tangled vines.
	At its center, a dry, moss-covered fountain sits like a forgotten relic, 
	its basin filled with rainwater and fallen leaves. 
	The statue that once adorned it, a weathered saint or perhaps a noble figure, 
	has lost its head to time, its features worn smooth by centuries.`,

var chapel = Room{RoomName: "chapel",
	LongDescription: `
	A ruined medieval chapel stands in solemn silence, 
	its crumbling stone walls half-consumed by ivy and time. 
	The roof has long since collapsed, leaving the interior exposed 
	to the elements; open to sky, rain, and creeping moss. 
	Arched windows, once filled with stained glass, now gape empty, 
	their tracery delicate but fractured. The altar lies broken, 
	worn smooth by centuries of wind and weather, 
	while fragments of sacred carvings: angels, saints, 
	and worn Latin inscriptions, peek out from the rubble.`,
